# Sample Hardhat Project

# Hardhat - is an Ethereum development environment and framework designed for full stack development.

In simple words you can write your smart contract, deploy them, run tests, and debug your code.

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```

making nft is a few lines of code, initializa a contract and make it an instance of ERC721,
then create a construct that takes the name of the NFT and the symbol it takes,
using \_mint function, mint 1 token to your wallet address
then compile and deploy with hardhat, hardhart is fullstack framework
